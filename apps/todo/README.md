Hint: Priority of ToDos will default to medium, if you do not set it.

## Create Short Lists

A lengthy list discourages from working on it in the first place. Keep your lists short. Focus on the important things that need to be done.

## Create Well-Defined ToDos

Do not be vague when defining your ToDos. The essence of the ToDo should be grasped in 3-5 words.

Hint: Optionally, you can set a description, if you want to elaborate on the ToDo.
